# PACTO BACKEND Using FastApi 
### By EDUCAMAS, COHORTE 8

#### STEPS

- Creating a project with an environment using= 
		python -m venv hellofastapiPY
- Activate the environment using= 
		hellofastapiPY_name/Scripts/activate
- You can also install it part by part.

This is what you would probably do once you want to deploy your application to production:

	pip install fastapi

Also install uvicorn to work as the server:

	pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

And the same for each of the optional dependencies that you want to use.

    Install packages with pip: -r requirements.txt
    How to write configuration file requirements.txt
    Export current environment configuration file: pip freeze

Remember install venv first and active the enviroment for using
